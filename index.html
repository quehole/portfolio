        <p>Founded in 2017, SZH provides free and also sells social media services, including followers, likes, and more. SZH has satisfied thousands of members by giving out free followers. SZH was originally founded by sqocket, who is a friend of mine, but after he quit development, I adopted and started SZH. I'm now the current owner of this establishment.</p>

          <h2>My development story:</h2>
          <p>In 2020 when I was 13 years old, one day me and my good friend Arnob suddenly got the motivation to start coding. We thought it would be the best if we start with Discord bot Development. The bot was made using JavaScript so we both started learning and making the bot. It was like competition "let's see who can make the better bot". So we both started working on our bot seperately. We would help eachother, if I needed help he always came and helped me. He was and still is better than me. Not too long later we both would finish our bots. My bot "Methane" and his bot "MelroseSnowyMint (MSM)" both bots were successful.</p>
          <p>After bot development we both would go on to making classic games using PYGAME. He made the better games and the games I made were so worse than him that I never released them.</p>
          <p>Then after we became Full-stack Developers we slowed down the Development. As of today I have had 4 out of 7 successful projects. Which I think is pretty cool.</p>
          <p>Thanks to Basel who gave me the motivation to start JAVA. And not just him, I thank everyone who helped and supported me throughout my coding journey.</p>
